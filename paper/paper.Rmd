## Abstract

### Importance

\newpage

## Introduction

TODO: Describe OptiClust and vsearch.

## Results

TODO: brief description of OptiFit algorithm. the method we came up with is the result. OptiClust paper had toy example to walk through the algorithm. 

TODO: Paragraph at beginning to describe datasets: why picked, how processed

- 16S rRNA gene sequence datasets from human gut, mouse gut, marine, and soil environments as well as the greengenes, silva, and RDP public databases were processed with mothur and clustered _de novo_ with mothur's OptiClust algorithm.
- All clustering was performed at a distance threshold of 0.03 and repeated with 100 different random seeds.
- The Matthews Correlation Coefficient was calculated to serve as a measure of OTU quality.

### Reference clustering with public databases

- Public reference databases were clustered _de novo_ using OptiClust, then query datasets were fit to the _de novo_ OTUs using OptiFit.
  - In open-reference mode, OTU quality was similar between fitting the datasets to reference OTUs with OptiFit and clustering the datasets _de novo_ with OptiClust. This held true for all datasets and reference databases.
  - However, in closed-reference mode, OTU quality was slightly worse when fitting to greengenes and silva, and much worse when fitting to RDP as compared to OptiClust. OptiFit was able to map more query sequences to reference OTUs created with the greengenes and silva databases than with RDP.
  - In terms of runtime, closed-reference OptiFit outperformed OptiClust, while OptiClust out-performed open-reference OptiFit.
  
### Reference clustering with split datasets

TODO: compare optifit performance for split dataset vs public database
TODO: double-check with Sarah that MCCs are from full OTU dataset or just query sequnce OTUs
TODO: double-check reference fractions aren't flipped (fraction mapped plot looks weird)

- Datasets were randomly split into a reference fraction and a query fraction. Reference sizes from 10% to 80% of the sequences were created, with the remaining sequences used for the query. Reference sequences were clustered _de novo_ with OptiClust, then query sequences were fit to the _de novo_ OTUs with OptiFit.
  - OTU quality from fitting split datasets was highly similar to that from _de novo_ clustering the whole dataset.
  - Closed-reference OptiFit with split datasets was faster than OptiClust on whole datasets.
    - OptiClust performed faster than open-reference OptiFit only when the OptiFit reference fraction was 30% or less.
  - Different methods for selecting the sequences to be used as the reference were tested; a simple random sample, weighting sequences by relative abundance, and weighting by similarity to other sequences in the dataset.
    - OTU quality was similar with the simple and abundance-weighted sampling, but slightly worse with similarity-weighted sampling.
    - The fraction of query sequences that are able to be fit to the reference OTUs in closed-reference mode decreases as the reference fraction increases.

### Comparison to vsearch    

TODO: move this into first section with public database.
vsearch is more permissive than mothur (radius vs diameter with 0.03 dissimilarity threshold).

- To compare to existing software, vsearch was used to cluster OTUs _de novo_ or with reference-based clustering to the greengenes database.
  - For all datasets and clustering methods (_de novo_, open reference, and closed reference), mothur's clustering algorithms produced higher quality OTUs than vsearch.
  - When closed-reference clustering against the greengenes database, vsearch was able to map more query sequences to the reference than mothur's OptiFit algorithm.
  - In terms of runtime, OptiFit genearlly performed faster than vsearch when reference clustering, while vsearch _de novo_ clustering outperformed OptiClust.
